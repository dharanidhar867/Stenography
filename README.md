Steganography is the practice of hiding secret information within another, seemingly innocent, piece of data. The goal is to conceal the existence of the hidden information so that it is not detected by others. The word comes from the Greek words steganos (meaning "covered" or "hidden") and graphy (meaning "writing" or "drawing"). Unlike encryption, which makes information unreadable without a key, steganography hides the information altogether, making it appear like there’s nothing unusual about the data.

Key Concepts:
Cover Medium: This is the file or message that will carry the hidden information. It could be an image, audio file, video, text, or even a network packet.

Payload: This is the secret information that you want to hide. It could be anything from a message, a file, or even a set of instructions.

Embedding Process: Steganography techniques embed the payload within the cover medium in a way that the change is imperceptible to the human eye or ear.

Extraction: The person receiving the cover medium can extract the hidden information, but only if they know the method (or key) to do so.
